# DCM_scripts
These are scripts that I have edited or created for the creation of models used in Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) for SPM12

DCM is a method for inferring the effective connectivity of underlying neuronal structures from changes in hemodynamic flow. 

In short, this is done through the generation and comparison of candidate models with acquired data.

The scripts compiled here are particularly useful in specifying and estimation large model spaces.

For any questions concerning the scripts please feel free to contract me at alecj@student.unimelb.edu.au
